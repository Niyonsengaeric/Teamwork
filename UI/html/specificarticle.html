                    href="#">WebPack </a>is not my thing,tried it and failed.
                  Those are the words of a developer drenched and soaked with imposter syndrome.
                  Over time we keep fighting ourselves, trying to run away from our shadows, trying to find shortcuts,
                  yes
                  I did also, I really did :(
                  At a point in my life, I just felt some things were not meant for me, I felt maths was too complex for
                  me, JavaScript
                  was not my thing!!
                  <span class="viewmore">
                    <h3>WHAT DOES THE GROWTH MINDSET MEAN?</h3><br>
                    Carol Dweck is the Lewis & Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology at Stanford University and the
                    author of Mindset:
                    The New Psychology of Success over 30 years ago, Dr Carol Dweck and her colleagues became interested
                    in students’ attitudes about failure. They noticed that some students rebounded while other students
                    seemed really devastated by even the smallest setbacks. After studying this behaviour in a lot of
                    children, Dr Dweck coined the terms<b>"FIXED MINDSET and GROWTH MINDSET"</b> to describe the
                    underlying beliefs people have about learning and intelligence.
                    According to the Harvard Business Review;<br>
                    Tobriefly sum up the findings: Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard
                    work, good
                    strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with
                    a more fixed
                    mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about
                    looking smart and
                    they put more energy into learning.<br>
                    Now, The Growth Mindset simply means having the mindset that your talents, skills or strength can be
                    developed over
                    time. It revolves around the belief that you can improve intelligence, talents, ability and
                    performance.<br><br>
                    <h3>The Fixed Mindset</h3> <br>On the other end is the opposite, it refers to the belief that a
                    person’s talents are
                    fixed and generated from birth. This revolves around the idea that once you can’t do something from
                    the onset, it
                    isn’t meant for you. Once you can’t solve that arithmetic, you conclude that maths is not your
                    thing, once you can’t
                    figure out that algorithm, you conclude that programming is hard.<br>
                    Recent advances in neuroscience have shown us that the brain is far more malleable than we ever
                    knew. Research on
                    brain plasticity has shown how connectivity between neurons can change with experience. With
                    practice, neural
                    networks grow new connections, strengthen existing ones, and builds insulation that speeds
                    transmission of impulses.
                    These neuroscientific discoveries have shown us that we can increase our neural growth by the
                    actions we take, such
                    as using good strategies, consistency, asking questions, practising, and following good nutrition
                    and sleep habits.
                    Mark Zuckerberg was not born a geek, Sarah Drasner was not born a Developer Avocado, Ire Aderinokun
                    was not born a
                    frontend developer, Prosper Otemuyiwa was not born on a Senior Level, they all started from
                    somewhere, learning and
                    Improving daily.<br>
                    This is the Idea we should embrace as developers/designers, It is never easy and accepting this fact
                    is the
                    beginning of you moving forward, but saying <b>“NO I CAN’T”</b> kills it all.
                    <b>DO NOT ENTERTAIN THE IDEA OF HAVING FIXED TALENTS, IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY, SKILLS ARE
                      IMPROVED, TALENTS ARE
                      SHARPENED.</b>
                    The fact that you are not getting it perfectly now, does not mean you should quit, it only means you
                    should be
                    consistent and improve with practice and good strategies.
                    The Growth Mindset is not focused on caring about success or achievements, but rather learning.
                    Learning is a
                    process, you just need to keep moving!<br>
                    When learning especially something new, the main goal should not be finishing but rather
                    learning.<br><br>
                    <h3>Advantages of The Growth Mindset<br></h3><br>
                    <b>The Growth Mindset</b> is a very buzzing topic and research has shown how much increase in
                    success it has birthed
                    after its evolution.<br>
                    <b>Here are some of the merits;</b><br><br>

                    - It Improves and builds self-esteem, learning orientation and reduces helplessness<br>
                    - It reduces stress and aggression as well as increasing wellbeing and emotional stability<br>
                    - It promotes adaptability and coping skills and develops better self-regulation<br>
                    - It Strengthens your Confidence and never makes you feel stupid while learning<br>
                    - It lowers your risk of Depression<br><br><br>


                    “The growth mindset does allow people to love what they’re doing — and continue to love it in the
                    face of
                    difficulties.<br>The growth mindset allows people to value what they’re doing regardless of the
                    outcome.” — Dr Dweck
                    Now, this is pretty much it, Plants don’t grow and become fruitful once its seed hit the ground, it
                    takes a lot of
                    weeding, watering, manuring and strategies to make it grow.<br>
                    This is how we operate as humans too, you need to undergo a lot of good strategies and consistency
                    to grow.<br>
